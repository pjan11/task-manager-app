Notes on daily tasks
=======================
* Created the basic react app components
* TaskItems, Tasks, and lists
* Updated the TaskItem Component to have Title, duration, and status
* Updated Lists to be 2 Lists, Open and closed
* Updated the interface to have a TaskList to contain both open and closed lists
* Created the TaskForm to input new Tasks
* The TaskForm and Task Item held the duration in a time format
* TotalTime Component was added to display the remaining time for the day
* OpenTaskList added up all of the durations from the tasks in OpenTaskList
* Closing a task updated the status and moved it to the closed list
* Total Open task time was moved to be part of the totalTime components
* TotalTime and task duration input was changed to a decimal input
* Styles were updated and initial responsive behavior was added
* Adding a python backend to store the tasks and daily lists into tables
* Working on testing the task create api, using an async function
* Dealing with CORS issues because the app is on port 3000 and the server is on port 5000
* Trying to use proxy in the package.json and installing flask-cors
* Finally fixed the server section and it looks like the POST task route worked
*** Review Python and the server files to understand the completed
* Use dbeaver to troubleshoot the database table
* Created a new connection to a SQLite db and the path was to the db in my app folder
* Use the network tab to see the issues in the api request
* Redid all of the server code and now that works
* Once the task is created successfully, the UI updates
* Added code to Git
* Updated home to have a ListView on the left and the TaskView on the Right
* ListView has a list of all of the lists in descending order and a button at the end to add a new list
* Created a dialog for the new list name form
